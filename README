This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-tis-ic4 layer.

The meta-tis-ic4 layer provides Yocto/OpenEmbedded recipes for The Imaging Source
IC4 camera framework, including the core library, GStreamer integration, GenTL
drivers for various camera interfaces, and a complete image recipe for camera
applications.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
  branch: scarthgap

  * ic4-gentl-driver-libcamera - libcamera integration driver

Package Groups:
  * packagegroup-ic4 - Core IC4 components package group
  * packagegroup-ic4-gstreamer - IC4 with GStreamer support

Images:
  * tis-ic4-image - Complete image with IC4 camera support

III. Building the TIS IC4 image
 IV. Runtime dependencies


I. Adding the meta-tis-ic4 layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-tis-ic4'

Or manually add the layer to your bblayers.conf:
  /path/to/meta-tis-ic4 \

II. Using IC4 components in your image
======================================

To add IC4 support to your existing image, add one of these to your image recipe:

For basic IC4 support:
  IMAGE_INSTALL += "packagegroup-ic4"

For IC4 with GStreamer integration:
  IMAGE_INSTALL += "packagegroup-ic4-gstreamer"

For individual components:
  IMAGE_INSTALL += "ic4 ic4-gentl-driver-usb3vision"

III. Building the TIS IC4 image
===============================

This layer includes a complete image recipe optimized for camera applications:

  bitbake tis-ic4-image

This image includes:
  * Complete IC4 framework with all drivers
  * GStreamer integration
  * Qt5 support
  * Camera utilities (v4l-utils, libcamera tools)
  * Development tools and libraries

IV. Runtime dependencies
========================

The IC4 framework requires:
  * Qt5 base libraries
  * GStreamer 1.0 and plugins (for GStreamer integration)
  * libusb1 (for USB3Vision cameras)
  * libcamera (for libcamera integration)
  * util-linux (for UUID support)

Camera-specific dependencies are automatically handled by the respective
GenTL driver packages.
